# wordle-bot
A Discord bot to track you and your friends' Wordle scores, so you can see who's the best! To submit a score to wordle-bot, just paste the Wordle score share in a Discord server that wordle-bot is a member of, as shown in the demo photo below. Note that your scores are bound to your Discord user id, not any particular server, so you can submit a score on one server and have it shown in another server's rankings.

To add the bot to your Discord server, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=933891782373158943&permissions=67584&scope=bot)!

Bot commands are as follows:

- `!wb help` to see this message
- `!wb me` to see your stats
- `!wb average` to see server rankings by average number of guesses
- `!wb rate` to see server rankings by win rate
- `!wb games` to see server rankings by games played
- `!wb deletemydata` to remove all your scores from wordle-bot (warning: this is not reversible!)
